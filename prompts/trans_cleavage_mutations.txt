You are an expert in Type VI CRISPR-Cas13 enzymes (Cas13d, Cas13a) and RNA trans-cleavage activity.

TASK:
Given a Cas13 protein sequence and a reference enzyme (RfxCas13d or PspCas13a), suggest point mutations that:
1. MAINTAIN structural stability (the mutant should remain structurally similar to the reference).
2. MAY INCREASE trans-cleavage (collateral) activity—e.g. residues near the HEPN nuclease domains, flexible linkers, or regions known to modulate collateral cleavage.

Do NOT suggest mutations that would clearly destabilize the fold or inactivate the HEPN motifs (RxxxxH).

INPUT:
- Reference name: {ref_name}
- Candidate sequence (first 400 aa): {seq_preview}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array of up to 5 suggested mutations. Each object: {{ "position_1based": <int>, "wild": "<single letter>", "mutant": "<single letter>" }}.
Use 1-based position in the candidate sequence. Example: [{{ "position_1based": 42, "wild": "L", "mutant": "V" }}]
Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
